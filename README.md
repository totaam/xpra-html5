# Xpra HTML5 client - Outdated, DO NOT USE

This repository was a clone of the xpra HTML5 client found here:
[xpra.org](https://xpra.org/trac/wiki/Clients/HTML5).
You can also browser the source [here](https://xpra.org/trac/browser/xpra/trunk/src/html5)
through xpra's tracker which has the advantage of showing links for commits and tickets.

Please use xpra's bug tracker instead:
[bug tracker](http://xpra.org/trac/wiki/ReportingBugs)

To use it, you will need an xpra server, which you can start with:
```
xpra start --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000
```
Then you can just point your browser to port 10000.

There is also an online version of the current version of the HTML5 client available here:
[current HTML5 client](http://xpra.org/html5/connect.html) (the server not supplied!).

For more information on using xpra, see [xpra usage](https://xpra.org/trac/wiki/Usage)
